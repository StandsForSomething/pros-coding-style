Introduction
============
This webpage is designed to outline a few simple guidelines that should be
followed by anyone maintaining C code for a KIDS Inc Robotics VEX robot.

Coding style varies from person to person, but anyone maintining code for a KIDS
Inc robot must follow these guidelines.

Changes
-------
changes may be made to these guidelines. If a commit to the git repositories is
more trivial than a change in wording, grammer corrections, or corrections in
spelling errors should be tagged and the version of these guidelines being used
in a given file should be noted (it's not allways reasonable to make all the
apropriate changes depending on what's changed and the size of the file).
